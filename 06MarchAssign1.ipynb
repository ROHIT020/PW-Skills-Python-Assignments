    "Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of\n",
    "each type of data.\n",
    "Ans-The data is classified into majorly four categories:\n",
    "    Nominal data\n",
    "    Ordinal data\n",
    "    Discrete data\n",
    "    Continuous data\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Nominal Data\n",
    "Nominal data is a sub-category belonging to one of the types of qualitative information. Also known as the nominal scale, it is used to label the\n",
    "variables without providing the numerical value for them. Nominal data attributes can’t either be ordered or measured. The nominal data can be both\n",
    "qualitative and quantitative in nature. For instance, some of the nominal data attributes are letters, symbols or gender, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examination of the nominal data is based on the usage of the grouping method. This method is based on the principle of the grouping of data into\n",
    "different categories. This is followed by the calculation of the frequency or the percentage of the data. The visualization of this data is done using\n",
    "the pie charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Gender (Women, Men)\n",
    "Eye color (Blue, Green, Brown)\n",
    "Hair color (Blonde, Brown, Brunette, Red, etc.)\n",
    "Marital status (Married, Single)\n",
    "Religion (Muslim, Hindu, Christian)\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Ordinal Data\n",
    "Ordinal data/variable is the specific type of data that follows a natural order.  The difference between the data values is not determined in the\n",
    "case of nominal data. For instance, ordinal data variable is mostly found in surveys, economics, questionnaires, and finance operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The examination of the nominal data is based on the usage of visualization tools. The visualization of this data is done using the bar chart. The\n",
    "ordinal data can be expressed in the form of tables which have each row corresponding to the distinct category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Feedback is recorded in the form of ratings from 1-10.\n",
    "Education level: elementary school, high school, college.\n",
    "Economic status: low, medium, and high.\n",
    "Letter grades: A, B, C, and etc.\n",
    "Customer level of satisfaction: very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Discrete Data\n",
    "Discrete data refers to the data values which can only attain certain specific values. Discrete data can’t attain a range of values. Discrete data\n",
    "can be represented using bar charts. For instance, ratings of a product made by the users can only be in discrete numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of students in a class,\n",
    "The number of chips in a bag,\n",
    "The number of stars in the sky\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Continuous Data \n",
    "Continuous Data can contain values between a certain range that is within the highest and lowest values. The corresponding difference between the \n",
    "highest and lowest value of these intervals can be termed as the range of data. Continuous data can be tabulated in what is called a frequency\n",
    "distribution. The frequency distribution table can be computed for the range type of data. It can also be depicted using histograms. For example, \n",
    "the heights of the students in the class can be largely varying in nature, therefore, they can be divided into ranges to summarise the data. \n",
