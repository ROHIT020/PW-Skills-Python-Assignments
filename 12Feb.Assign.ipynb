    "\n",
    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It may be due to various reasons such as invalid input, division by zero, out of memory, or trying to access an undefined variable. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted, and the program terminates.\n",

    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Additionally, exceptions can be handled and resolved programmatically, while syntax errors must be fixed manually by the programmer."
